git clone this repo and run the install script:

git clone <link> src/vlcscan
cd src/vlcscan
bash install.sh

DISCLAIMER
I'm new to programming and this was for a work project, so I used perplexity.ai a bit during this project mostly to help me personally mentally parse through the API documentation for e.g. python-vlc. I believe I understand the code
